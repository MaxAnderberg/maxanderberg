## ‚úçÔ∏è Blog

Writing is something that I enjoy, and I think it's a good to spend time once in a while writing, it helps you with cementing the knowledge but at the same time you can help others. 

At the moment I'm creating a blog written in GatsbyJS with the headles CMS Contentful. I plan on featuring the repo once I got the MvP up and running.
